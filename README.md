Project Description

The game starts with a short comics about main character‚Äôs dream - winning a snowboarding competition. This comics is shown only once when the game runs the first time. Then player needs to register either locally or via Play games. The game has four modes: bronze league cup, silver league cup, golden league cup and endless sliding. First three has finite mountain roads. Bronze league cup mode‚Äôs obstacles are predefined, but silver and golden‚Äôs are randomized with different frequency, as golden mode is more difficult than silver mode. When a player starts a game first time, only one mode is available - bronze league cup. Then player is shown a tutorial. After the first game the endless sliding mode is available. Player needs to avoid different obstacles and to collect likes and boosters by controlling character via touchscreen or gyroscope. Game ends if character collides with an obstacle. In bronze league cup mode, as well as in silver and golden, the goal is to reach an end of a road, collecting as many likes as possible. There are finish line and appropriately coloured goblet in the end of each road. After collecting the bronze cup the silver league cup mode will be available, and after collecting the silver cup - golden league cup mode. The endless sliding mode is a road with randomized obstacles. The goal in this mode is to survive as long as player can. In the end of each game player‚Äôs score is shown.
